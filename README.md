# rock-paper-scissors

Basic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Chance for me to practice more with classes and using them as object.

2 Versions at present, one creates all objects within the init in the class and then just creates 1 instance of the class.

The second manually calls each method from the class with instructions written in between.

Not sure which would be best to use!
